# RushDojo
## CPSC-362-Project
## Software Engineering Project
## Name: Jovanni Trujillo
### Brief Overview
This project is all browser based as it is a tool that's themed as a dojo training environment. RushDojo offers users to add tasks, run a countdown timer, track daily streaks, and unlock achievements based on their progress. The timer is set to 25 minutes, allowing users to take a break after they do 25 minutes of work. ALl data is stored locally so that the user's streaks and all of their completed tasks gets saved across sessions.
### Functionality
This project uses a HTML, CSS< and JavaScript frontend and has no external backend server. All of the applications logic is handled directnly in JavaScripot.
The system uses localStorage to save the users data like their tasks, streaks, and completed task counts. The main interface is index.html, it contains task list and timer while the secondary page being achivements.html; displays all of the unlocked achievements.
### Testing
Testing was all done manually with different types of tests like task creation, task removal, timer behavior, streak updates, achievement unlocking, and data persistence.
Since the project runs entirely in the browser, testing was more focused on verifying correct UI and also seeing if localStorage was updating right.
